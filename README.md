# The Alethe Calculus in AletheLF

This repository contains a work-in-progress implementation of the Alethe calculus in AletheLF.

See `docs/introduction.md` for an overview of the differences between the standalone Alethe syntax, and Alethe in AletheLF.

See the `examples/` folder for example proofs in both formats.

Finally, the `signature/` folder contains AletheLF signature files for Alethe.
