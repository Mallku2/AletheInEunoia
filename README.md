# The Alethe Calculus in Eunoia

This repository contains a work-in-progress implementation of the Alethe calculus in Eunoia.

See `docs/introduction.md` for an overview of the differences between the standalone Alethe syntax, and Alethe in Eunoia.

See the `examples/` folder for example proofs in both formats.

Finally, the `signature/` folder contains Eunoia signature files for Alethe.
